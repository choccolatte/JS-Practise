Project Wordup

Highlight/underline a text (word)

highlighted text will be sent to either - 

	- database of dictonary if you are using a db
	- or it will call an API or go to google search and search for that word

the result will be displayed on the screen - meaning, synonyms, antonyms, best usage, etc. 

and it will be there until the user search for the next word 

so, the history will still be there until the user decides to clear it.
